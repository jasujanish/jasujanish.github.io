      description: "Course Number: 15150\nTaken: Spring 2025\n15150 is one of the most interesting courses I've taken so far.\nFunctional programming is a disciplined and type-oriented programming paradigm that emphasizes immutability, modularity, and mathematical reasoning. This course introduced me to numerous functional programming concepts, but the most significant lesson I learned was the importance of visualizing more abstract concepts, such as infinite sequences or trees, when writing algorithms. As such, this course greatly improved my ability to reason about and elegantly solve problems.",

However, I ended up greatly enjoying the course's mathematically rigorous approach to probability theory. Additionally, the course has greatly strengthened my proof-writing skills and mathematical intuition, making it one of the most valuable courses I've taken at CMU.",

Overall, I found the course's emphasis on visualizing concepts in three dimmensions and computational problems greatly enjoyable.",
